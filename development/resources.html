It's a great way to get a feel for polycount, topology, texturing methods, etc. Keep in mind that you shouldn't use these for commercial purposes.

                          <h2>Bryce</h2>
                          This program is kind of wacky to use, especially if you have experience with more traditional 3d software. Here's stome stuff.
                          <br><br>
                          <a href="https://archive.org/details/Bryce3DCD">Bryce3D for Windows.</a> Requires emulating a much older version of windows - I was using Windows 98. Kind of a hassle, but free* (*so old no one cares).
                        <br><br><a href="https://www.daz3d.com/bryce-7-pro">Bryce 7 Pro</a>. Costs 35 dollars - cheap for 3d, expensive compared to theft. This version works on modern operating systems, and boasts a tree editor to boot. Has a semi-active forum community, even though DAZ has kind of abandoned it. 
                        <br> Daz does a poor job explaining how to actually install this stupid thing, so here you go: 
                        <li>
                          Make an account with Daz when you purchase Bryce7.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Go to My Account. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Go to Product Library. You'll now see a whole list of products. 'Bryce7' and 'Bryce7 Pro' are listed seperately. </li>
                        <li>Click 'Bryce7'. There will be a list of different file options to download, and one 'install manager' option. Ignore that one. Look for the file that says 'bryce7' (NOT BryceContent), plus your operating system listed, and download that. </li>
                        <li>Install Bryce7 from this file. Go ahead and install it to whatever path you'd like, just remember the path for later.</li>
                        <li>Now, go back to the product library. Click on 'Bryce7 Pro'.</li>
                        <li>Find the 'BryceContent' (NOT Bryce Lightning) file that includes your operating system, download and install. If you specified a differnt installation path, remember to copy-paste the same one here. This step is technically optional, but the Pro content pack comes with a LOT of materials for you to use. </li>
                        <li>Under My Account, locate the 'serial numbers' tab. The serial number for your copy of Bryce7 will be here.</li>
                        <li>Register your serial number in Bryce7.</li>
                        <li>All done!</li>
                     <br>
                     Bryce7 comes with a user manual, but here are some more resources for you:
                     <br>
                     <br><a href="https://www.bryce-tutorials.info/" target="_blank">Brycetutorials</a> is the defacto tutorials webpage for Bryce. Great starting points here. <br>
                     <br><a href="https://archive.org/details/realworldbryce40000kitc" target="_blank">Real World Bryce4 By Susan A. Kitchens.</a> I know what you're thinking; "That's 3 versions behind this one!" Don't worry, it really isn't that different. Hell, the userguide that comes with Bryce7 is actualyl for Bryce6!
                     <br><br><a href="https://archive.org/details/advancedbrycecre00mort/page/n9/mode/2up" target="_blank">Advanced Bryce Creations by R. Shamms Mortier.</a> Intended originally for Bryce4.1, but again, all info is good info with this thing. 
                     <br><br><a href="https://archive.org/details/kptbrycebook00kitc/page/n7/mode/2up" target="_blank"> The KPT Bryce Book</a>. This one seems way older, could still come in handy, though!

                        God, I hate programming for web. Here's some stuff. 
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://sadgrl.online/" target="_blank">Sadgrl.online</a> is kind of like the Da Vinci of the personal website renaissance right now. She has a ton of incredible resources and much better tutorials than anything i'm gonna throw at you over there. Go, go, go!
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools.com</a> is a very useful reference guide for programming sites. 
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web" target="_blank">Mozilla also has their own reference guide</a> for the web- I personally have been finding that one more useful lately. 
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VS Code</a> is a great free code editor. Use it. Don't use Neocities's code editor or you'll make me cry. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server" target="_blank">Here's an extension for vs code that lets you live preview your code changes.</a>
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/" target="_blank">The Web Design Museum</a> Has archives of fantastic-and less than fantastic- websites from the years of 1991 to 2006. A great reference for those wanting to make a website with a bit of retro flair.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://archive.org/details/web-design-wow" target="_blank">Web Design Wow! Companion CD</a> Sadly, there's not a digitization of this wonderfully outdated website book, but this companion CD comes with demo files for website editors. Could be fun for all you retro program lovers. 
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://ruffle.rs/" target="_blank">Ruffle</a> is the current biggest and brightest Adobe Flash emulator. Not only can you use it as an extension so you can explore all of your favorite websites, but you can also embed it in your website so you can play flash content!
                        <a href="https://archive.org/details/animatearchive_FlashCS5.5-WIN" target="_blank">Speaking of which, here's a download for Adobe Flash CS5 Professional.</a> It's dead, so who cares? There's still many, many flash tutorials up on the internet. Double check Ruffle's webpage to see how their compatability for AV3 is coming along; currently, you can only work with actionscript 2.0. 
                        <br><br>

                        <a href="https://archive.org/details/macromedia_dreamweaver3_zdwwin30cdx" target="_blank">Do YOU want to use Macromedia Dreamweaver in the 21st century?</a> Yes?
